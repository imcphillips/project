# Question 1

## Comments
I wrote this while consulting the referenced solutions bellow, because bitcoin.org's official documentation is not very complete. This is the only answer which directly references existing solutions. I was able to use official documentation for everything else. 

I wanted something simpler which had everything hardcoded, no unused code paths, and kept all the logic inside the dockerfile instead of splitting a small portion of it into the entrypoint script.
