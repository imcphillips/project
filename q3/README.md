# Question 3

## Comments
I made a Github Actions workflow because I've used it more recently. I have experience with Github Actions, Gitlab CI, Jenkins, Chef, ArgoCD and other related tools. 

I'm putting this all into one file here, but you'd organize it differently in reality depending on you org's standards. Also there would be logic to control exactly when it would run which steps, as opposed to just 'on: push'. This is your company git workflow.

Official documentation, and I've used all these actions many times.
